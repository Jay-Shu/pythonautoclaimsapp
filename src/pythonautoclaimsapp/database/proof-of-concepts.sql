	Author Notes:
		Inspired by my time at Hyland working with Phil Mosher and Brandon Rossin.
		GO Keyword does not require a semi-colon. As it would be redundant.
		BEGIN...END Blocks have been phased out completely for TRY...CATCH and GO.
        BEGIN TRANSACTION...COMMIT TRANSACTION Blocks to be used. As it is intended
            for the application to be running these statements.
        This is intended for proofing any theories
